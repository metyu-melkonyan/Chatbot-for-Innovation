## What it does
This notebook-driven project turns any PDF (and easily extensible data sources)
into a conversational knowledge base:

1. **Ingest** ‚Äì Extracts text with **pdfplumber**, chunks it using
   **RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter**, and embeds it with **OpenAI** models.  
2. **Store** ‚Äì Persists embeddings in a local **Chroma** vector database
   (`./chroma_db`) so you can pick up right where you left off.
3. **Chat** ‚Äì Runs a `ConversationalRetrievalChain` (LangChain v0.1+) with memory,
   powered by **GPT-4o/3.5** (`ChatOpenAI`), letting you ask follow-up questions
   naturally.
4. **Share (optional)** ‚Äì Expose the bot to teammates with one command via
   **pyngrok**.

Typical use-cases include rapid policy analysis, literature deep dives, and
interactive Q&A for hackathons or classroom demos.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites
* Python ‚â• 3.10
* An **OpenAI API key**
* (Optional) Ngrok account & authtoken if you want a public URL
* Git + Jupyter

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/<your-user>/Chatbot-for-Innovation.git
cd Chatbot-for-Innovation

# 2. Create & activate a virtual env (recommended)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Configure your key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

# 5. Launch notebook
jupyter notebook Chatbot.ipynb
````

Run the cells in order:

1. **Ingest** ‚Äì point to your PDF(s) and build the vector store
2. **Chat** ‚Äì interact with the `qa_chain`
3. **Publish (optional)** ‚Äì execute the ngrok cell for a public link

Re-opens of the notebook skip ingestion‚Äîyour vectors stay in `./chroma_db`.

### Example queries

```text
‚Ä¢ What are Canada's main innovation challenges?
‚Ä¢ How could Canada better compete with China and the U.S. in AI R&D?
‚Ä¢ Why does the report suggest embedding SR&ED consultants in innovation hubs?
```

## Extending the bot

| Goal                              | Where to start                                                 |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Index more file types (HTML, CSV) | Add extraction helpers in **Chatbot.ipynb** before the chunker |
| Turn notebook into an API         | Wrap the chain in **FastAPI** or **LangServe**                 |
| Custom front-end                  | Connect with **Streamlit**, **React**, or **Langflow**         |
| Multi-model support               | Swap `ChatOpenAI` for Anthropic or local LLMs via LangChain    |
